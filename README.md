Data Engineer | BI & Analytics | Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) | Snowflake, Databricks, Spark, Power BI | ML & Generative AI


## About Me  

I’m Jeevaharan, a data professional with nearly 4 years of experience building scalable data platforms and analytics solutions. My work focuses on data engineering and cloud-based systems, where I’ve designed high-performance data pipelines, orchestrated complex workflows, and supported large-scale migrations from on-premises environments to cloud platforms such as AWS and Snowflake. I’ve also worked on Generative AI and LLM-based proof of concepts, developing chatbot and AI-driven solutions integrated with enterprise data systems.

I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the University at Buffalo (SUNY), with a strong foundation in statistical data mining, machine learning, and data-intensive computing.

I enjoy building reliable, maintainable data systems and collaborating with teams to solve real-world problems at scale.
